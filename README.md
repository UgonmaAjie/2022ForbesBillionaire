The most interesting part for me is knowing that being a billionaire in not only for the adults; 19 years old Kevin David Lehmann is the youngest Billionaire from Germany with a NetWorth of $2.4B in the Fashion Industry.

And if you're not yet 100 years old as George Joseph of United States with a NetWorth of $1.8B, you can still be a billionaireüòÅ.
